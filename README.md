# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification (MLOps Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple **Machine Learning + MLOps setup** where we predict the species of Iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements.  
The main goal of this assignment is to **set up version control** for both code and data using **Git + DVC**.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Predict the type of Iris flower (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) given its features like:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
- File: `iris.data` (stored in `data/raw/` and tracked using DVC)
